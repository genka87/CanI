Can I ?
=======

Goals:
------
Create a .net  authorization component that can decouple authorization from roles/actions/...
Loosely based on ruby's cancan gem

Usage for an MVC application
----------------------------


Features:
---------
- Setup a demo project
- Action-based authorization filter for http requests (mvc only at the moment)
- Simple viewhelper to show/hide controls

Roadmap:
--------
This project is written in the RDD fashion: ReadMe Driven Development.

Near Future
***********
- Add authorization on ViewModels

Far Future
**********
- Create NuGet package
- Think about a plugin for NHibernate
